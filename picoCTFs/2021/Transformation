Description:
I wonder what this really is... enc ''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])

HowTO solve it:
Downloading and executing the enc gives:
灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸弰㑣〷㘰摽

a bunch of characters...


trying to decrypt and understand the line:
''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])

<< is a bitwise shifting operation. 

So by guessing that shifting flag[i] by 8(bits) and then adding the flag[i+1] to it we get a 2-byte(16bits) character,
(1 character is 1 byte ( or 8 bits ) in UTF-8 ) we can assume that the output is 16-bit encoded.

If we then encode the string we got by utf-16-be we can get the original flag.
Using python:
decode_string="灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸弰㑣〷㘰摽"
print( decode_string.encode( "utf-16-be" ) )

running this will result in the output
b'picoCTF{16_bits_inst34d_of_8_04c0760d}'
